This repository is for Jonathan Wibowo's Networks in Psychology Network Analysis Project:

The project involves an analysis of the DASS-21 using a network perspective framework. Within this analysis, 
key symptoms which are hypothesised to reduce the severity of the disorder were identified and possible reasons 
for why a treatment might be successful is postulated based on the current findings. 

Inside this repository you will find the following:
Network_Analysis.Rmd -- contains the Rmarkdown script that was used to conduct the analysis 
Video_Report_Network_Analysis_Video.mp4 -- contains the video report for the project
data.csv -- raw data obtained from the open psychometrics website (name chosen to match the R script code)
