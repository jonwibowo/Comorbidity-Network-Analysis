# Network Analysis of Comorbid Mental Symptoms
This project involved an analysis of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) using a network perspective, that is, to conceptualize symptoms as a set of interconnected nodes. 

In this analysis, I identified potential target symptoms which (theoretically) reduce the severity of the disorder. 
Additionally, I offer possible reasons for why current treatments may or may not be as successful in treating comorbid (i.e., concurrent) disorders. 

Inside this repository you will find the following:
- Network_Analysis.Rmd -- contains the Rmarkdown script that was used to conduct the analysis 
- data.csv -- raw data obtained from the open psychometrics website
