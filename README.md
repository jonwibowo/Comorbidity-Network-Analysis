# Network Analysis of Comorbid Mental Symptoms
This project involved an analysis of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) using a network perspective framework. In this analysis, I identified 
key symptoms hypothesized to reduce the severity of the disorder and offer possible reasons 
for why a treatment might be successful based on the current findings.
