# Comorbidity-Network-Analysis
A repository containing my capstone project for PL4246 (Networks in Psychology) module at NUS.

The project involves an analysis of the DASS-21 using a network perspective framework. In this analysis, I identified 
key symptoms hypothesised to reduce the severity of the disorder and offer possible reasons 
for why a treatment might be successful based on the current findings. 

Inside this repository you will find the following:
Network_Analysis.Rmd -- contains the Rmarkdown script that was used to conduct the analysis 
data.csv -- raw data obtained from the open psychometrics website (name chosen to match the R script code)
