# Network Analysis of Comorbid Mental Symptoms
This project involved an analysis of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) using a network perspective framework. 

In this analysis, I used network analysis to identify potential target symptoms which are hypothesized to reduce the severity of the disorder. 
Additionally, using the findings I offer possible reasons for why current treatments may or mau not be as successful in treating comorbid (i.e., concurrent) disorders. 

Inside this repository you will find the following:
- Network_Analysis.Rmd -- contains the Rmarkdown script that was used to conduct the analysis 
- data.csv -- raw data obtained from the open psychometrics website
